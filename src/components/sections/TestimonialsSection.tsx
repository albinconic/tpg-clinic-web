                            &quot;I've been to many different chiropractors and physical therapists in the area over the years. My sessions with Arash were much different than any other session I've had with other therapists. A couple weeks ago I was able to summit half-dome, a 19 mile hikeâ€”I absolutely would not have been able to do that without Arash and the awesome crew at Prehab.&quot;

It's thanks to Adelle that not only am I stronger than before I tore my ACL but I can now go weeks without thinking about any differences between my right knee and left knee, something that hasn't happened since I got injured!&quot;

Without his feedback and instruction, it is highly unlikely I would be feeling as great as I do today!&quot;
