        TL;DR — I've been rehabbing with [P]REHAB for just under a year now and would highly recommend them to anyone and everyone recovering or coming back from an injury.<br /><br />
        I can't say enough good things about [P]REHAB. Adelle, Marissa, and entire team have been THE BEST.<br />
        I had surgery for a torn ACL & meniscus in December of 2023 and originally worked a different PT and it wasn't until August 2024 that I started working with [P]REHAB.<br /><br />
        While I'm still on my rehab journey today (just about a year and a half out from my surgery), I don't know where I'd be without Adelle. She's been so attentive, a great listener, and pushes me when I need some extra motivation.<br />
        I'm confident that I'll be back to my pre-injury level of activity and doing the things I love (soccer, tennis, running, beach volleyball) again here soon!

        Prehab has helped me achieve my goals of becoming more flexible and developing a stronger core.<br /><br />
        I came to Dr. Monica with some flexibility issues and she was able to help me improve noticeably in just a couple of weeks. Her exercises are so targeted to exactly the parts of my body that needed most work. Overall it feels very efficient and I was very impressed by how accurately she could pin point weak spots and help me strengthen them.<br />
        I can't recommend her highly enough, she was very knowledgeable and fun to work with.<br /><br />
        The good thing about Prehab is that they are able to help you work on whatever issue you have and tailor a program just to you.<br />
        Marisa was also very helpful during my time at Prehab and helped me schedule all my appointments.

        After a shoulder injury, and encouragement from a physiatrist, I signed up for a package with Prehab Physical Therapy.<br />
        It also helps that one of my friends, who happens to be a physical therapist, also referred me to this clinic. He shared great things about this place, so the bar was already set high.<br /><br />
        My therapist Dorian was engaging, patient and incredibly knowledgeable. In addition to assigning practical, doable and strength-building workouts each week, he explains why they're important and how they fall under the program.<br />
        I thought I knew how to work out, as I've been lifting for almost a decade now, and it was all undone after just a few short but impactful months with Dorian. I quickly learned I had to relearn most of what I knew, and I appreciated it.<br /><br />
        Before I wrap up this review, I do want to highlight the office manager, Marisa, who was such a delight at every interaction. She made scheduling a breeze and was always so awesome to deal with. I always walked away with a smile after interacting with Marisa, who genuinely knows how to put patients at ease.<br /><br />
        Note: Unfortunately, Prehab Physical Therapy was out of network with my medical insurance. However, Marisa provided a superbill after each visit, which made insurance claim submissions easy.<br /><br />
        I am walking away with a stronger appreciation of form in my workouts and a new profound respect for stretching. If you're looking for a knowledgeable therapist and a modern clinic, check out Prehab Physical Therapy.

        I have had a rough time with a C6/C7 radial nerve impingement on my left side for the last 6.5 years. It was a wrestling injury.<br />
        Prior to working with Dorian online, I had tried countless face-to-face physios. The best face-to-face physio I had eliminated the pain and helped me avoid surgery.<br /><br />
        Dorian has helped me build strength and stability in the affected muscles. I now don't hear my shoulder pop every morning, and I'm actually seeing muscle growth again in my left triceps, chest, and shoulders.<br /><br />
        The three months I worked with Dorian was a massive game changer – I’m on the path to fully balancing my left and right side. I couldn't recommend Dorian enough.

        I'm a nomad and had been dealing with lower back, hip, and knee pain for about two years, but I didn't really have the option to work with a PT in person because I move too often.<br />
        When I found Prehab's virtual PT program it seemed like the perfect fit: I could do the moves on my own, it's much more affordable than paying for consistent in-person PT, and I could continue my program and work 1:1 with a therapist from anywhere in the world.<br /><br />
        I saw Dorian, and he's the best physical therapist I've ever worked with. He's clearly so knowledgeable and invested in his patients' success — he programmed moves I never would have thought to do myself, was always empathetic in hearing about my issues and pain, and was always a pleasure to catch up with during appointments.<br /><br />
        As a virtual patient, I never felt rushed or like an afterthought. Prehab's online exercise library is great, and really helps you nail the proper form even when you're working on your own.<br />
        I worked with Dorian for about 6 months and am leaving finally feeling capable and strong again.<br /><br />
        I'd recommend Prehab and Dorian in a heartbeat to anyone looking to try online PT!
