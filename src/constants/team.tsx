        Adelle is an LA native through and through – so no surprise she stayed in sunny SoCal for her graduate career,
        graduating from USC with her Doctorate of Physical Therapy, alongside some of her colleagues here at Prehab PT!
        <br />
        <br />
        Adelle has extensive experience in sports and orthopedic settings, treating recreational athletes of all ages,
        specializing in lower extremity and post operative rehab such as ACL, meniscus, and cartilage injuries and surgeries.
        In addition to all things knees, Adelle's professional passions lie in helping active and motivated individuals
        get back in the gym &amp; on the field/court – no matter their history, complexity, or previous PT experience!
        <br />
        <br />
        Her clinical approach integrates strength and conditioning principles into a rehab setting, to ensure all her patients
        get back to the things they love at 110%! She focuses on taking a proactive and personalized approach to help guide
        and empower her clients and get them back to living their best lives! Because PT isn't just physical – It's personal.
        <br />
        <br />
        But Adelle is more than just a PT, she is a loving dog mom and wife to her fellow classmate turned husband, Mike!
        In her spare time you can catch her volunteering at her local animal shelter, binging reality TV (and during football
        season cheering on the 49ers), in the gym, and catching some rays at the beach!

        realms of strength training and rehabilitation to provide prehab, or preventative rehabilitation, to his patients.
        <br />
        <br />
        A common human behavior is to address problems after they become an issue and far often too late, which is a
        reactionary approach. He believes the key to improved health care is education and awareness. This proactive
        approach—prehab—can reduce the risk of injuries and pain in the first place. He is a huge proponent of movement
        education and pain science. Clinically, he has a special interest in ACLR rehab and return to sport for the lower
        extremity athlete.
