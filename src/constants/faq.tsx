    question: "Do you take my insurance?",
    answer: `We are considered an out of network (OON) provider for most major insurance<br />
companies and can provide you with a superbill for each of our sessions to go towards your out of network deductible/reimbursement. Each of our clients is responsible for submitting their superbill to their insurance carrier directly.<br /><br />
We also accept FSA/HSA!<br /><br />
As a courtesy we are able to verify OON benefits for all new clients but always encourage clients to re-verify their benefits with their insurance carrier directly.<br /><br />
This model of care is designed accordingly in order for us to deliver the highest level of care you deserve. Ultimately, you will save money &amp; time by working with us and investing in yourself.<br /><br />
Let us know if you have any questions as we’re happy to explain why and how.`

However, insurance reimbursement without a referral will depend on your specific insurance plan/policy, which is something we can help you learn and determine.`
